# LunaCrypt | Hard | [malware,reversing,osint,forensics]

Hi Analyst,

We've been hit by the infamous LunaCrypt Ransomware Group! We need your help to restore some encrypted files!

Attached is a 7-zip archive containing the encrypted files (`victim-files/`) and the Zip archive which was downloaded from what appears to be a staging server following encryption (`LunaCryptDecryptor.zip`). Contained in the 7-zip is the decryptor utility created by the ransomware group.

Please note the password to the 7-zip is `infected`.

Good Luck

CIRT

**NOTE**: This challenge is based off of a real malware sample but has been neutered and defanged to prevent unintended execution. Windows Defender will likely identify it as malicious, so it is strongly advised to only analyse this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production machine.
