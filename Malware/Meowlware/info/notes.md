# LunaCrypt

Intended solve:

- Unzip the provided archives and note `.git` exists within the decryptor utilities Zip file
- Analyse the `.git` via `git log` and identify the previous commits with the encryption and key construction functions
- Analyse the original sourcecode and identify the key is the SHA256 of the first file (`Bliss_(Windows_XP).png`) with every fourth character (from 0) changed to the corresponding character in variable `string2`
    - Hash:    `7af0efb2dd0984af998db27ebb3243d666a94a28dffc6f2e498967b2571c5c4e`
    - String2: `6f2dc9a8e5f1b4dc2b8a3e4f6c7d9a8b1f2c3a7e4b1f2c3a7e4b1f2c3a7e4b1a`
    - Key:     `6af0cfb2ed09b4af298d327e6b3293d616a93a284ffc2f2e798917b2371c4c4e`
- Carry out OSINT to find the `Bliss_(Windows_XP).png` file (source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(image))) and determine its hash
- Use the hash and key constructor function to determine the key: `6af0cfb2ed09b4af298d327e6b3293d616a93a284ffc2f2e798917b2371c4c4e`
- Run the decryptor utility to get the flag: `flag{lun4cryp7_15_b4d_4t_43s_ac99a742}`
