# VBS Vendetta | Medium | [malware,vbs,powershell,obfuscation]

Hi Analyst,

We received an alert for a suspicious file that was executed on a user's host which resulted in some strange behaviour. Unfortunately, it is heavily obfuscated so we need your help to see what the final payload is.

Attached is a 7zip archive containing the malicious VBS script which we acquired from the user's host during our investigation - `56418-MaliciousVBS.7z`. Contained in the 7Zip is the VBS script which we were alerted to, namely `freeRAM.vbs`.

Please note the password to the 7zip is `infected`.

Good Luck

CIRT

**NOTE**: This challenge is based off of a real malware sample but has been neutered and defanged to prevent unintended execution. Windows Defender will likely identify it as malicious, so it is strongly advised to only analyse this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production machine.
