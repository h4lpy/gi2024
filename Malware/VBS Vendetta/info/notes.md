# VBS Vendetta | Notes

Intended solve:

- Can remove junk from VBS via:

```
^REM .*
^Private Const .*
^\n\n
```

- Identify that the remainding function calls simply craft a large PowerShell string `powershell "..."`
- Extracting the PowerShell string, we find various function calls
    - One to invoke expression
    - One to extract the 8th consecutive characters within the string
- Working with the second function to decode the strings, the final variable is the flag
- Flag is `flag{1f8e9a5c3b7d2f4e6a1b3c5d7e9f2a4}`
