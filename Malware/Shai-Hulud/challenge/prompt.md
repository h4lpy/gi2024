Hi Analyst,

During a routine security audit, we were notified of a suspicious file on one of our ICS workstations which was thought to be airgapped. We believe the binary is gathering information in preparation to move to a second stage.

Unfortunately, we have not been able to progress further. Can you investigate how the file is communicating and see if you can retrieve the second stage?

Please note the password to the 7-zip is `infected`.

Good Luck

CIRT

Windows Defender will likely identify it as malicious, so it is strongly advised to only analyse this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production machine.
